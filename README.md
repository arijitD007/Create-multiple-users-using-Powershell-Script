# Create-multiple-users-using-Powershell-Script
I have written a Powershell Script, using this script anyone can add multiple users in their Active Directory domain. This script is built for adding multiple users in AD domain in one go.
I have added a names.txt file that contains random users name, anyone can modify that name
